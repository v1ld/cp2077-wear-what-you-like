Wear What You Want
==================

Come across a lovely jacket that has no slots on it that you wish you could slap some mods into and wear?  Come across an ugly motorcycle helmet with a Bully and Fortuna mod equipped on it?  Wish you could have 4 slots on that jacket?  Wish you could unequip the mods from that helmet and put them on the jacket?  This mod lets you do both those things: change the rarity of armor pieces so they get more slots and unequip mods from armor so they can be reused elsewhere.

The number of mod slots depends on the type and rarity of an armor.  Shirts and jackets get 4 slots each at Legendary, while all the others get 3 slots at Legendary.

Installation
============

This mod requires the "Cyber Engine Tweaks" mod from https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107.  Install and get that working first, including assigning it a hot key to bring up the console.

Copy the bin folder contained in the .7z archive you downloaded to the root of your Cyberpunk 2077 install, which should already contain a bin folder.

If installed correctly, a WearWhatYouWant window will open up along with the CET console.

Usage
=====

Go to the Inventory window and check you're wearing the pieces you want to change.  Use the CET hot key to bring it up, along with the WWYW window.  Select the armor pieces you wish to either upgrade the rarity of or unequip mods from.  Click the appropriate buttons and you're done.

Note: sometimes you'll come across clothing that has less than the normal slots for their rarity.  If you remove the mods from such clothing - even if seems to have no mods equipped - a hidden internal mod named ME-THRILL will pop out.  Once this is removed the clothing will behave as usual and have all the slots you expect.  Break down your ME-THRILLs for components if you like.

I looked closely at two mods for implementation details and code when putting this together:
- [pvpxan's LegendaryLite (with quest flag remover)](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1414)
- [Captain12's Gameplay Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1421)

Much thanks to both of them.
